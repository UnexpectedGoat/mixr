  ## Description 
  The art of mixing cocktails is more than just the need for a buzz, it's the rewarding experience of combining the freshest ingredients with the kick of hand-crafted liqueurs to create consumable works of art. Or it's vodka and red bull yoloing into the night. Regardless of your style, with more folks spending time at home and out of bars, a replacement is needed for the mustachio aproned hipster delivering you the most “lit” cocktails to your table. Meet mixer, delivering your cocktail ideas via a MVC paradigm using MySQL, Express, and handlebars. The unique feature of Mixr is that you stock a virtual pantry with cocktail items you have laying around, then you can search the 600+ cocktails available via cocktailsdb.com based on what you actually have on hand. Not feeling that structured? That's fine, go for a bartender’s choice and Mixr will provide you with a random cocktail either of drinks you can make, or any drink of your choosing. Please enjoy responsibly, take care of each other, and relax with a craft cocktail. You've earned it
